            <h1>about anime</h1>
            <p>Anime is a form of Japanese animation and has changed the way eastern animation is created and has had a
                major affect on western animation as well. Anime has influenced western cartoons such as Steven Universe
                and Adventure.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>did you know?</h2>
            <p>The first Japanese film was introduced in 1907? It was tilted, Katsudō Shashin, and the original animated
                series Osamu Tezuka’s: Tetsuwan Atom Astro Boy premiered January 1, 1963. In 1958, the first major
                animation studio surfaced. That studio became Toei Animation which is responsible for later adapting
                popular manga into anime such as Dragon Ball (1986), One Piece (1999), Sailor Moon (1992), Digimon
                (1999), and Astro Boy (1963).
                The popularity of anime still emerges today. These animation clips are a great experience to watch for
                any age. Many people around the world are still watching anime and enjoying it as they have since 1907.
