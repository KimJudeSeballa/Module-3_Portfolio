                <h2>You can call me Patty!</h2>
                <p>My name is Patricia Ann Villarosa and I was born on August 1, 2001. I was raised by my mother and grandmother in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental Province. Growing up with a single parent – my mom, wasn’t actually a big deal for me because my mom did everything to make sure that I’ll never feel lonely or incomplete. My childhood was like any other normal kids, spending my whole afternoon playing outside with my childhood friends and watching movies. My mother and her siblings really gave me a full attention and used to spoil me with a lot of stuffs like fancy clothes and phone. I spent the 13 years of my life in Bacolod City and then I moved in to my aunt’s place in Davao City. At first, it was hard to adjust with the new environment, the culture, people and even the language that they speak. But as time passed by, I found some great friends and enjoyed staying in the city of Davao. I’m proud to say that I am an honor student since kindergarten and still maintaining my good grades in college. My hobbies are dancing and playing volleyball. I don’t know why but dancing makes me feel more alive and connected to the music. It’s like grooving and just letting my body move with the beat. I’ve also joined various competitions when I was in grade school like hiphop, modern dance competitions, beauty pageants, volleyball competitions and etc. I also enjoy doing outdoor activities like going to the beach and taking adventures. It’s like taking a break from all the stress in reality and appreciating the beauty of nature that surrounds me. <br> <br> One of my goals in the future is to go in every countries and cities in the world because I love seeing wonderful destinations and I want to know more about other cultures. I also like socializing with people and make new friends. I feel like I get to know more about people’s personalities and perspectives whenever I talk to someone.  By the time I reach 30 years old, I see myself as someone who is successful and capable of having a stable career and life. Someone who pursued her skills in business and technology industry and working in a famous tech company. Also, at that age, I assume that I could already provide my family with a lot of things, build a house and have a family business. </p>
