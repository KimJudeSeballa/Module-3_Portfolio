        <br>Gender: Male
        <br>Age: 22
        <br>Birthdate: September 05, 1999
        <br><br>Hobbies:
        <p>I love to play soccer. I used to be an active player. 
        Me and my brother went to different places to participate in different tournaments
        Unfortunately I got sick and was banned from too much sunlight.
        This made me spend most of my time inside and play computer games.
        I love online games since I could play with my friends eventhough we are all apart. 
        I also love jogging and biking but due to my health issues
        I usually jog and bike aroung evening to avoid sunlight exposure.
        I have 4 brothers. My parents wanted a daughter but God gave them 5 sons instead.
        I am blind. To be precise my left eye is blind. It started when i was 5 years old.
        My neighbor shot my left eye with a barbeque stick luckliy it did not reach my brain.
        I only have limited vision which soemtimes hinders me from dangers of my left vision.
        My left eye is also afraid of lights it automatically shuts when there is a strong light.</p>
        Goals:
    </h2>
        <p>My goal is to live a normal life and simple. I want to graduate like anyone else. I want to help my parents and my brothers if ever they need help.
            I don't have impossible dreams nor big ambition, I just want a life with not much problem to encounter with my loved ones!
