                <h2>Thailand</h2>
                <h3>Every year, more and more tourists visit the Land of Smiles, Thailand.</h3>
                <p>From white sandy beaches and terrific hotels to historic temples and mouthwatering food, there's simply too much on offer in this tropical paradise for visitors.
                    If you’re wondering what else you can see in Thailand, take the sleeper train and head to the northern part of the country. The sleeper train goes all the way north where it stops in Chiang Mai, the city between the mountains. 
                    <br><br>Visit the Doi Suthep Temple overlooking the city. Take your time and observe the locals making offerings and praying. On your way back to the city you’ll encounter many opportunities to explore the unknown and maybe book a trip for the next day. 
                    Or, you can book now for more relaxed travelling. You can choose among visiting the nearby river rapids, exploring the neighbouring villages or spending a day with rescued elephants by taking care of them and learning a great deal. Don’t miss the chance to visit the magnificent tropical forests and spectacular waterfalls.
                    <br><br>If you want to sleep in a traditional Thai house with a typical Thai garden, but want to feel the travel spirit, then we recommend staying at HI Chiang Mai, located in a quiet neighbourhood close to the Night Bazaar. Go further north on a trip to the second Chiang, that is Chiang Rai. Once there, don’t miss the opportunity
                      to discover the Golden Triangle and the White Temple with this offer, which includes delicious Thai food. You can visit ancient ethnic groups that have been preserving their traditions for centuries. Lake Phayao is perfect if you want to meditate for a bit and wish for world peace. </p>

                <h2>Ancient History</h2>
                <p>A number of indigenous Mon-Khmer and Malay civilizations used to live in the region now known is Thailand. Yet little is known about the area prior to the 13th century since literary sources are scarce and most of the knowledge we have today is taken from archeology only. Thailand's cultural influences have included the culture and religions of India, the Kindgom of Funan, and the Khmer Empire. The “Indianized” kingdoms – what is now central Thailand, 
                    Srivijaya, and Cambodia – contributed to the flow of Buddhism from India to what was known as Siam. Other influences throughout the centuries included the Maurya Empire, the Pallava dynasty, and Gupta Empires of India.<br><br>
                    From about the 10th to the 14th centuries, Thailand saw a period of Khmer domination over a large portion of what is now Central Thailand, as well as a southward expansion of Thai tribes. Thai city states gradually became independent as the Khmer Empire weakened. The Lanna - based in Chiang Mai, Sukhothai, and Ayutthaya Kingdoms, among others, ended up wrestling amongst each other for control. The Kingdom of Ayutthaya ended up being successful in 
                    retaining its independence from other countries and city states. Ayutthaya maintained independence for about 400 years before falling to the Burmese as other city states had previously done.  The state of Thonburi, located in the region that now contains Bangkok, was taken back by General Taksin in 1768. From his capital of Thonburi, Taksin used his power throughout Thailand to liberate the city states from Burmese control and reunite them.  
                    The resulting country was then called Siam. The Lanna kingdom was also effectively liberated and retained its own form of independence in Northern Thailand.<br><br>
                    Thailand's diplomacy skills led them to enter into various treaties with western nations during the period starting in the late 18th century. Thai relations were built particularly with Britain and France. Many say this diplomatic strategy may be the only reason that they retained control during a time of such heavy western colonization in the region.

                <h2 style="text-align: right;">Modern History</h2>
                <p>The Thai people established their own states in the early 20th century, with the Ayutthaya kingdom showing itself to be the most dominant for a time. The states were all constantly threatened by the Khmers, Burma, and Vietnam, not to mention the presence of the French and British who were vying for colonies in Southeast Asia at the time. When European colonial powers threatened in the 19th and 20th centuries, Thailand managed to escape as the only 
                    country not to fall under colonial rule. This was due to a compromise between the French and British to keep it as a neutral territory between them. The Siamese Revolution was sparked by young military personnel and other civil workers in 1932. This event ended the absolute monarchy of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and established a constitutional monarchy that was largely overseen by military personnel. Civilian and military factions bickered over power 
                    in the newly established government, and fear of communism and ultra-nationalism caused instability amongst them. Thailand endured sixty years of military rule, oftentimes with no clear direction or leader aside from the top general.<br><br>
                    The current military leaders at the time of World War II opted to ally Thailand with Japan to avoid becoming a victim in its path. During the postwar era, Thailand maintained close ties with the United States, avoiding adherence to the communist influences that many of its neighbors embraced. A democratic government was established in 1992 which has resumed to the present day. </p>

                <p style="width: 50%;">The magnificent Phraya Nakhon Cave is one of the most mystical and mysterious landmarks of Thailand but only a few travellers get a chance to take a picture of it. 
                    The reason is simple: this gold and green pavilion is hidden inside a hard to reach cave and only a handful of dedicated visitors will do the effort to visit it. Those who do are rewarded with a stunning vision that looks like it's straight out of an Indiana Jones movie.
                    Phraya Nakhon Cave is located in the Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park in Prachuap Khiri Khan province, a 45 minutes drive south of Hua Hin.

The lighting at night makes the temple even more exotic and beautiful.
